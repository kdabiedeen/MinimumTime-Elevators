# MinimumTime-Elevators-Python
Calculate minimum time to reach top given number of floors in a building and a set of elevators via input file

Run Example:
For test1.txt input file --> 'python elevators.py test1.py' in terminal

Assume 'John' is on floor 0. All elevators move at the rate of 1 floor per second in the current direction it is moving. All elevators initially move upward and once an elevator reaches the top, it begins to move in the opposite direction and does not make stops in between its minimum and maximum stop. This program simulates the fastest route in order to find the minimum time where John can reach the top.
